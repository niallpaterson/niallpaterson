## Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niall

### I'm on a mission ðŸš€ to craft clean functional code, to add value and do my bit. 

I enjoy working in `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `React`, `HTML/CSS`, `SCSS`, `Git`, `Jest`, `Express`, `Supertest`, `AVA`, `Enzyme`, and `ZSH`. 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Raglan Wharf Gallery: an ecommerce site for a company in Raglan New Zealand, built in functional React, 
- Factory.create: a package to streamline factory function production in JavaScript,
- Count-line: a package for retrieving line counts of large files without relying on readStreams, and
- and more. . .  (check out [this project](https://github.com/users/niallpaterson/projects/5)).

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning, but right now its:

- How to get the best out of currying,
- How to use JS's Reflect object,
- How to cash in on prototypal inheritence, and
- How to write nuanced, effective unit and integration tests.

### ðŸ¤¯ Iâ€™m fascinated by:

- Functional programming, esp. function composition ðŸ¥°,
- Software architecutral design patterns, and
- Modal logic, particulary its theoretical applications.

Don't be shy, say hi @ <niall.paterson@pm.me>
