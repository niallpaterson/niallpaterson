## Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niall

ðŸš€  I'm on a mission to craft clean, functional code, to add value and do my bit. ðŸš€  

I enjoy working in `JavaScript`, `node.js`, `React`, `HTML/CSS`, `SCSS`, `Git`, `Jest`, `Enzume`, and `ZSH`. 

I'm currently looking for opportunities around the South West, to help me grow as a developer.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Refactoring my personal projects until they're squeaky clean ðŸ§¼,
- Building an API in node.js,
- Building a bullet journal CLI,
- and more. . .  (check out [this repo](https://github.com/users/niallpaterson/projects/5)).

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning, but right now its:

- How to write beautiful object constructors,
- How to get the best out of aysnchonous JS,
- How to cash in on the wonders of prototypal inheritence, and
- How to write nuanced, effective unit and integration tests.

### ðŸ¤¯ Iâ€™m fascinated by

- Functional programming, esp. function composition ðŸ¥°,
- Software architecutral design patterns, and
- Modal logic, particulary its theoretical applications.

### ðŸŽ“ Fun fact:

- Before putting my skills to use in tech, I was an analytic philosopher
- I worked on knowledge, belief, dispositional properties, risk, biological functions, and the mind-brain identity thesis.
