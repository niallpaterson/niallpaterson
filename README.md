## Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niall

### ðŸš€ My mission? ðŸ‘‰ To craft clean functional code, to add value and do my bit. 

I enjoy working in `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `React`, `HTML/CSS`, `SCSS`, `Git`, `Jest`, `Express`, `Supertest`, `AVA`, `Enzyme`, and `ZSH`. 

### ðŸ¤¯ Iâ€™m fascinated by:

- Functional programming, esp. function composition ðŸ¥°,
- Software architecutral design patterns, and
- Modal logic, particulary its theoretical applications.

Don't be shy, say hi @ <niall.paterson@pm.me>
